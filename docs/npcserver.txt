NPC ids < 1000 cannot be deleted.  Why?
^--- not sure why this message is here, but I noticed database npcs start with 1000

- RC requests address of npc-server once it receives a player with the (Server) nickname. Not sure if it makes a difference, but level is set as a space " ", account can be anything.
