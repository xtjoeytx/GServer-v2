How-to setup a server:

1) Under the accounts folder, rename the text file 'YOURACCOUNT.txt' to your account name.  For example: 'KuJi.txt'
2) Modify defaultaccount.txt to your liking.  This is the default settings new players will start with.  It can also be modified via RC.
3) Open config/serveroptions.txt and edit it to your liking.  Be sure to modify the settings under "Private server options".  Help for what these options do are available on the forums and in the file itself.
4) Find the line that starts with "staff=" in config/serveroptions.txt.  Replace YOURACCOUNT with your account name.  Anybody who needs RC access must be added to this line with their account names separated by commas.  Additionally, RC users must have their IP range changed to at least *.*.*.* in their account to connect.
5) Port forward if needed. (Many threads on this topic exist in the forums.  If you are having trouble, seek them out.  Try the tutorials forum.)  Basically, if you are behind a router and your computer isn't set to be the "DMZ", you will need to port forward.
6) Run gserver.exe -- enjoy.
7) Report any bugs on http://www.graal.in/
