  Changelog for:

  * bug fix, + new feature, o other
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Server doesn't crash on a malformed weapon anymore.  Instead, it will display a warning.
* Version 2.2.0's setlevel2 bug fix involved with warping to the current level is properly fixed now.
* Fixed a crash when editing server flags via RC.
* Fixed an issue where, if the player tried to log in to a non-existent level, the gserver wouldn't send them to the unstickme level.
* Fixed a Linux case issue that cropped up if you manually created an account.txt file.
* Worked around a bug in RC 1.1.
* Fixed an infinite loop caused by killing baddies that were spawned via script.
* Fixed some NPC-Server related issues.
* The ServerHQ is properly updated when the settings are changed.
+ Added Downsider's execscript triggeraction hack.  The triggerhack_execscript server option turns it on and off.
+ Added gr.attr1 - gr.attr30 triggeraction hacks.  The triggerhack_props server option turns it on and off.
+ Added the ability to rename rclog.txt and serverlog.txt via the RC file browser.
+ Added UPnP support.
+ Added support for the RC2 disconnect message.
+ The server checks if a player is dead when they "leave" a level.  If they are dead, it brings that back to life with 0.5 hearts.  This is consistent with official Graal.
+ Added support for the NPC-Server sendrpgmessage() command.
+ Added built-in RC file browser protections to the config/ folder.  accounts/defaultaccount.txt, config/adminconfig.txt, config/allowedversions.txt, config/ipbans.txt, config/rchelp.txt, config/rcmessage.txt, and config/rules.txt require the 'change staff account' right.  config/foldersconfig.txt requires the 'set folder options' right.  config/servermessage.html and config/serveroptions.txt require the 'set server options' right.
+ Player flags are now sent to the NPC-Server.
+ Added support for say2 signs sent to a player by the NPC-Server.
+ Added the gr.setplayergroup triggeraction for setting the group of a specified player.
+ Added the gr.updatelevel triggeraction hack.  The triggerhack_levels server option turns it on and off.
o Updated adminconfig.txt to have ns_ip=AUTO at the end.
o Updated YOURACCOUNT.TXT to have access to folders that the default was missing.
o Updated serveroptions.txt with a bunch of new options.
o Servers are now hidden from the server list (marked as under construction) if the 'onlystaff' server option is set to true.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Some admin-only server options weren't in the list of protected options. They are now.
* Server now correctly deletes an empty string flag.
* A player's online seconds, kills, and deaths will now display correctly in their profile if their values exceed 1568735.
* Sign text is no longer trimmed.
* The server correctly handles UTF-8 file names in Windows now.
* Fixed a bug where moving a file in RC would fail to move the file and delete the original.

* Fixed a bug where the client's guild wasn't being cleared internally.
* If a player issues a setlevel2 command to warp to the same level he is in, the server just moves the player instead of attempting to warp him. This fixes some script issues with isleader.
* RCs will use their properly set nickname now, instead of using the nickname saved to the user's account file when they last logged in as a normal client.
* Fixed the creation of new directories via RC. It can now recursively create new directories.

+ Comments in settings files can be placed anywhere now.

  Changelog for:

Bugs fixed:
- Fixed modifying player flags via RC.
- The gserver will now correctly display RC and npcserver version strings on connect.
- The gserver no longer mangles UTF-8 filenames on Windows.
- Players can no longer gain hearts if they have low AP.

Changes:
- GServer uses non-blocking sockets.  Hopefully this will fix problems where the server can block on a send() call to a slow client.
- zlib and libbz2 are now packaged with the server gserver source code.  It makes it easier to compile.
