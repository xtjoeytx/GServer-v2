  Changelog for:
    v2.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugs fixed:
- Fixed modifying player flags via RC.
- The gserver will now correctly display RC and npcserver version strings on connect.
- The gserver no longer mangles UTF-8 filenames on Windows.
- Players can no longer gain hearts if they have low AP.

Changes:
- GServer uses non-blocking sockets.  Hopefully this will fix problems where the server can block on a send() call to a slow client.
- zlib and libbz2 are now packaged with the server gserver source code.  It makes it easier to compile.
