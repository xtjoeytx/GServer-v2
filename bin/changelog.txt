  Changelog for:
    v2.3.0 (WIP)

  * bug fix, + new feature, o other
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* GServer now defaults ns_ip (NPC-Server IP) to AUTO if it can't read it from the adminconfig.txt - This fixes NPC Server in RC.
+ Added protection for important files rather than preventing rw config/* now you can give people rights without worrying about them stealing your adminconfig.txt password.
  Note on protection: People with 'change staff accounts' can edit any file in config/* but cannot delete/move/rename them (to avoid messing up the server)
  Also, people with 'edit server options' or 'edit folder config' can directly edit the serveroptions.txt & foldersconfig.txt files respectively.
+ Now supports sendrpgmessage() packet from NPC-Server.
o Updated adminconfig.txt to have ns_ip=AUTO at the end.
o Updated YOURACCOUNT.TXT to have access to some folders the default was missing.
o The new protection added for protecting config/* also completely protects defaultaccount.txt from being modified.

  Changelog for:
    v2.2.0

  * bug fix, + new feature, o other
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Some admin-only server options weren't in the list of protected options. They are now.
* Server now correctly deletes an empty string flag.
* A player's online seconds, kills, and deaths will now display correctly in their profile if their values exceed 1568735.
* Sign text is no longer trimmed.
* The server correctly handles UTF-8 file names in Windows now.
* Fixed a bug where moving a file in RC would fail to move the file and delete the original.
* Player gani parameters #P6 through #P9 should be correctly passed to other players now.
* String arrays in the profile field are correctly tokenized now.
* Fixed a bug with saving weapons where the SCRIPTEND field wasn't being written correctly in some instances.
* The RC command /restartserver no longer ignores the server overrides specified in servers.txt.
* The gr.removeguild triggeraction hack will remove the guild tag from all currently online players when the guild is deleted.
* Fixed a bug where the client's guild wasn't being cleared internally.
* If a player issues a setlevel2 command to warp to the same level he is in, the server just moves the player instead of attempting to warp him. This fixes some script issues with isleader.
* RCs will use their properly set nickname now, instead of using the nickname saved to the user's account file when they last logged in as a normal client.
* Fixed the creation of new directories via RC. It can now recursively create new directories.
* Fixed a bug with the sparring deviation decay algorithm.
+ Comments in settings files can be placed anywhere now.

+ Added new server options to enable/disable all the various triggeraction and flag hacks.
o Updated readme.txt with a bunch of information about the Graal Reborn gserver, including information on all the triggeraction hacks.
o Updated the build system to premake 4.

Bugs fixed:
- Fixed modifying player flags via RC.
- The gserver will now correctly display RC and npcserver version strings on connect.
- The gserver no longer mangles UTF-8 filenames on Windows.
- Players can no longer gain hearts if they have low AP.

Changes:
- GServer uses non-blocking sockets.  Hopefully this will fix problems where the server can block on a send() call to a slow client.
- zlib and libbz2 are now packaged with the server gserver source code.  It makes it easier to compile.
