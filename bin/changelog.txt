  Changelog for:
    v2.3.0 (WIP)

  * bug fix, + new feature, o other
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed an oversight in protection that didn't let you edit the defaultaccount.txt from RC.
* GServer now defaults ns_ip (NPC-Server IP) to AUTO if it can't read it from the adminconfig.txt - This fixes NPC-Server in RC.
+ Servers are now automatically hidden from the list (marked as UC) if onlystaff is set to true.
+ Added protection for important files rather than preventing rw config/* in the folder config.  Now, you can give people rights without worrying about them stealing your adminconfig.txt password.  foldersconfig.txt requires the 'set folder options' right.  rcmessage.txt, servermessage.html, and serveroptions.txt requires the 'set server options' right.  Everything else requires the 'change staff account' right.
+ The gserver now supports the sendrpgmessage() function from an NPC-Server.
o Updated adminconfig.txt to have ns_ip=AUTO at the end.
o Updated YOURACCOUNT.TXT to have access to folders that the default was missing.

  Changelog for:
    v2.2.0

  * bug fix, + new feature, o other
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Some admin-only server options weren't in the list of protected options. They are now.
* Server now correctly deletes an empty string flag.
* A player's online seconds, kills, and deaths will now display correctly in their profile if their values exceed 1568735.
* Sign text is no longer trimmed.
* The server correctly handles UTF-8 file names in Windows now.
* Fixed a bug where moving a file in RC would fail to move the file and delete the original.
* Player gani parameters #P6 through #P9 should be correctly passed to other players now.
* String arrays in the profile field are correctly tokenized now.
* Fixed a bug with saving weapons where the SCRIPTEND field wasn't being written correctly in some instances.
* The RC command /restartserver no longer ignores the server overrides specified in servers.txt.
* The gr.removeguild triggeraction hack will remove the guild tag from all currently online players when the guild is deleted.
* Fixed a bug where the client's guild wasn't being cleared internally.
* If a player issues a setlevel2 command to warp to the same level he is in, the server just moves the player instead of attempting to warp him. This fixes some script issues with isleader.
* RCs will use their properly set nickname now, instead of using the nickname saved to the user's account file when they last logged in as a normal client.
* Fixed the creation of new directories via RC. It can now recursively create new directories.
* Fixed a bug with the sparring deviation decay algorithm.
+ Comments in settings files can be placed anywhere now.
+ Flag hack gr.ip added.
+ Triggeraction hacks gr.appendfile, gr.writefile, and gr.rcchat added.
+ Added new server options to enable/disable all the various triggeraction and flag hacks.
o Updated readme.txt with a bunch of information about the Graal Reborn gserver, including information on all the triggeraction hacks.
o Updated the build system to premake 4.

Bugs fixed:
- Fixed modifying player flags via RC.
- The gserver will now correctly display RC and npcserver version strings on connect.
- The gserver no longer mangles UTF-8 filenames on Windows.
- Players can no longer gain hearts if they have low AP.

Changes:
- GServer uses non-blocking sockets.  Hopefully this will fix problems where the server can block on a send() call to a slow client.
- zlib and libbz2 are now packaged with the server gserver source code.  It makes it easier to compile.
